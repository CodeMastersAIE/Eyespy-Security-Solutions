              * Transportation is one of the several industries that we have provided our CCTV solutions. 
              <br><br>* Our work has been appreciative on the country’s highways, train station, and bus stations to name a few. 
              <br><br>* We have provided them with a robust security camera solution. 
              <br><br>* During the tragic war period, Sri Lanka lost many innocent lives due to lack of security with the transport industry. Bomb blasts and other tragic incidents continued to occur even after the end of war. Very rarely those who put these lives in death have brought to justice. This itself an evident that our transport industry is less secured. Our transportation sector is frequently exposed to petty crime, harassment, liability suits, and vandalism.
              <br><br>* Many crowded places like bus stops and railway stations in Sri Lanka are an ideal place to rob the public.
              <br><br>* Public harassment has been increasingly common
              Damage of public (transport) property are damaged irresponsibly and no traces of the door is found.
              <br><br>* Traffic rules are increasingly disregarded, and drivers tend to drive at their own convenience, increasing a number of accidents.
              <br><br>* No correct records of how accidents occur reduce the chances of analyzing the situation and producing the correct solution.
              <br><br>*  In the case of a serious incident, such as explosions, no evidence is obtained to study the true scenario.
              <br><br>* Our CCTV solutions are designed to insulate transportation systems from security threats and become safer environments for passengers.
